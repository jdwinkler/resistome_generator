CRP is a homodimer and consists of two domains connected by a short hinge region. The C-terminal &alpha;-helical DNA-binding domain carries a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif. It dimerizes in apo-CRP, with the DNA recognition helix F buried within its core <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Sharma H, Yu S, Kong J, Wang J, Steitz TA,2009</a>. The N-terminal dimerization domain mainly consists of &beta;-sheets and carries a hydrophobic pocket for binding of cAMP. A long &alpha;-helix, termed the C-helix, forms an intersubunit coiled-coil. This helix plays a central role in the allosteric activation of CRP. Allostery arises as a natural consequence of changes in global low-frequency protein fluctuations on ligand binding, and there are conserved residues crucial for allosteric control <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rodgers TL, Townsend PD, Burnell D, Jones ML, Richards SA, McLeish TC, Pohl E, Wilson MR, Cann MJ,2013</a>.

In the presence of nitrate or nitrite NarL or NarP binds to a target site upstream of the binding sites for FNR, IHF, and Fis, counteracting the effect of IHF but not that of Fis.

ECK125269260	ECK120011229	FNR	FNR is the primary transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth through the regulation of hundreds of genes. Generally, this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Salmon K,2003. Kang Y,2005</a>. FNR also regulates the transcription of many genes with other functions, such as acid resistance, chemotaxis, cell structure, and molecular biosynthesis, among others <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Salmon K,2003. Kang Y,2005</a>.  The cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Sutton VR, Mettert EL, Beinert H, Kiley PJ,2004</a>, but its activity is regulated directly by oxygen. Under anaerobiosis, FNR acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of  the protein that causes it to become activated <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Moore LJ, Kiley PJ,2001</a>.

ECK125269282	ECK120012316	AraC-arabinose	The "<b>ara</b>binose regulator," AraC, is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in arabinose catabolism and transport. It coregulates with another transcriptional regulator, CRP; both are transcription factors involved in l-arabinose degradation. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose. Transcription of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator. In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gallegos MT,1997.

In the presence of hypochlorite, HypT becomes active due to oxidation of three methionines (Met123, Met206, and Met230). A probable conformational change upon oxidation allows the protein to bind DNA to regulate transcription. Oxidation of HypT is reversed by the presence of the methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA and MsrB, resulting in an inactive protein <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Drazic A,2013</a>			ECK12	Active

As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a> showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates <i>nikABCDE</i> expression and nickel uptake (for this, <i>rcnA</i> must be expressed at a basal level prior to induction, as observed with higher nickel levels) <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>.

The stability of <i>pspF</i> mRNA is enhanced by a RIB element (bacterial interspersed mosaic element) in the 3'-flanking region of the <i>pspF</i> transcript <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Jovanovic G, Model P,1997</a>.  The PspF protein belongs to the enhancer-binding protein family of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activators (bEBPs).

When assembled into a ring, the AAA+ domain uses the energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to remodel the &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase holoenzyme so that it can transition from the closed to the open complex. The AAA+ domain contains all conserved motifs of the AAA+ family, including Walkers A and B for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the second region of homology (SRH), which contains arginine fingers for intersubunit catalysis <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ogura T, Wilkinson AJ,2001.

As a member of the bEBP family it carries two additional sequence insertions: the L1 loop containing the GAFTGA motif and the L2 loop (also termed the pre-SIi loop). The L1 loop is known to interact with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, presumably with region I of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>. Zhang et al. (2012) showed that L1 is multifunctional, since it interacts with three elements important for isomerization from RP<sub>c</sub> to RP<sub>o</sub> (the RNAP closed and open complexes, respectively). On one hand, L1 contacts the DNA nontemplate strand immediately upstream of the -24 promoter element, and on other hand, it contacts two PspF L1-binding sites, residues 18 to 25 and 33 to 39, within &sigma;<sup>54</sup> RI <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zhang N, Joly N, Buck M,2012</a>.

ECK125269347	ECK120012029	PutA	PutA is a flavoprotein with mutually exclusive functions as a transcriptional repressor and membrane-associated enzyme.  The switch between the two activities is due to conformational changes triggered by the redox state of FAD.  In the presence of proline, PutA is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and acts a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both reactions of the |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| pathway: the oxidation of proline by proline dehydrogenase and subsequent oxidation to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase.  The kinetics of the coupled reaction is best described by substrate channeling.  In the absence of proline, PutA is cytoplasmic and functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <i>put</i> regulon.    The N-terminal 47 residues with a ribbon-helix-helix fold contain the dimerization domain and the specific DNA-binding activity of PutA <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gu D, Zhou Y, Kallhoff V, Baban B, Tanner JJ, Becker DF,2004.

The membrane-associated form of PutA does not bind <i>put</i> promoter DNA; thus, the enzymatic and DNA-binding activities of PutA are mutually exclusive <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zhang W, Zhou Y, Becker DF,2004</a>.

On the other hand, LrhA also regulates negatively and partially the translation of <i>rpoS</i> through two mechanisms, one of which is RprA dependent and the other one is RprA independent. RprA is a small RNA that regulates positively the translation of <i>rpoS</i>.

The C-terminal 83 amino acids form the tetrameric core, which carries the high-affinity nickel-binding site and resembles the ACT fold of the ACT (aspartokinase, chorismate mutase, TyrA) family. Two N-terminal domains intertwine to form a dimeric DNA-binding ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domain <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Chivers PT,1999</a>. The two RHH DNA-binding domains flank the tetrameric core of the protein <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Schreiter ER, Wang SC, Zamble DB, Drennan CL,2006</a>.

The signal that triggers this signaling pathway is glucose 6-phosphate external. This sugar is sensed by UhpC, which interacts with UhpB to stimulate its autophosphorylation. Then, phosphorylated UhpB transfers the phosphate group to UhpA in Asp-54 to activate it <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Verhamme DT,2001</a>. UhpB unphosphorylated is able to dephosphorylate to UhpA <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wright JS,2001. Verhamme DT,2001</a>.

DhaR belongs to the family of bacterial enhancer-binding proteins which contain three domains: the sensing domain located in the N terminus, the central AAA+ domain, and the C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif involved in the interaction with DNA. Although the C-terminal domain and the N-terminal domain from DhaR are similar to those of other members of this group, its central domain is not <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bachler C,2005</a>.

However, when it was found that this protein only regulates two genes, the suggestion was rejected and it was proposed that probably high concentrations of fatty acids could degrade the protein instead of it binding to the regulator <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Sampaio MM,2004</a>.    MngR belongs to the GntR family of transcriptional regulators and has a helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal domain and a UbiC transcription regulator-associated domain that is predicted to be a sensor for small molecules.  This domain is found in proteins such as UbiC from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, TreR from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and HutC from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Aravind L,2003</a>.  The <i>mntR</i> gene is transcribed divergently from the <i>mngAB</i> operon.  They share a regulatory region that contains two sites of 21 bp each, one with two direct repeat sequences of 10 bp that are bound by MngR <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Quail MA,1994</a>.  <i>mngR</i> shows differential codon adaptation, resulting in differential translation efficiency signatures, in thermophilic microbes.  It was therefore predicted to play a role in the heat shock response.  An <i>mngR</i> deletion mutant was shown to be more sensitive than wild-type specifically to heat shock, but not other stresses <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Krisko A, Copic T, GabaldÃ³n T, Lehner B, Supek F,2014</a>.

ECK125285357	ECK125285348	DgoR	DgoR belongs to the FadR subfamily within the GntR family of transcriptional regulators, and its DNA-binding operator sequence is [5'-TTGTA(G/C)TACA(A/T)-3'] <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Singh B,2019. Rigali S,2002</a>. The signature of GntR family regulators that also bind inverted repeats is [5'-(N)yGT(N)xAC(N)y-3'] <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Suvorova IA,2015</a>.  There are three IRs (inverted repeats) in the regulation regions of the <i>dgo</i> genes. DgoR binds the IR1 and IR2 sites in the cis-acting element for repressing the <i>dgoRKADT</i> operon, and IR1 is essential for DgoR activity. The D7, L34, T40, R42, R46, and S51 amino acid residues are important for DgoR to bind its cis-acting element. On the other hand, the IR3 site is not critical for the interaction of DgoR with its cis-acting element <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Singh B,2019</a>.  The DgoR binding sites overlap with the promoter, repressing the transcription of the <i>dgoRKADT</i> operon by occluding the binding of RNA polymerase <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Singh B,2019. Rojo F,1999</a>.  Based on a bioinformatics study, DgoR exists together with its binding sites in 13 genomes of different bacterial species, with the majority of members belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Suvorova IA,2015</a>.  Production of the enzymes involved in D-galactonate degradation are induced by growth on galactonate <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Deacon J, Cooper RA,1977</a>. The inducer is most likely D-galactonate itself; thus, DgoR may bind D-galactonate <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cooper RA,1978</a>.  D-galactonate is a specific effector of DgoR; it induces a conformational change in DgoR to derepress the <i>dgoRKADT</i> operon <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Singh B,2019</a>.

ECK125285358	ECK125285349	CsqR	CsqR, formerly known as YihW and hypothesized to be a transcriptional regulator <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Denger K,2014</a>, functions as a repressor for genes of catabolism of sulfoquinovose (SQ), a hydrolysis product of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Shimada T,2018</a>. CsqR belongs to the DeoR family of transcription factors. It acts as a carbon source-dependent dual regulator involved in sustaining baseline growth in the absence of the <i>lac</i> operon <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kaznadzey A,2018</a>. CsqR is likely involved in regulation of lactose metabolism and functions either in a complementary or opposite manner to a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism, cAMP-CRP, and functions as a sugar-dependent dual regulator <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kaznadzey A,2018</a>.  CsqR is part of a cluster of genes involved in degradation of sulfoquinovose (SQ); see the |FRAME: PWY-7446| pathway.  The activity of the CsqR transcriptional regulator is controlled by SQ and sulfoquinovosyl glycerol (SQG) during the exponential growth phase. Both SQ and SQG act as inducers for the <i>yihUTS</i> operon and <i>yihV</i> gene, and also for <i>csqR</i> expression <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Shimada T,2018</a>.  			ECK12	Active

ECK125285362	ECK120013131	GatR	"<b>Ga</b>lac<b>t</b>itol <b>r</b>egulator," GatR, negatively controls the expression of an operon involved in transport and catabolism of hexitol galactitol <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Nobelmann B,1996. Nobelmann B,1995</a>. The <i>gatYZABCD</i> operon is expressed constitutively due to an insertion of IS<i>3E</i> into the <i>gatR</i> gene <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Nobelmann B,1996</a>. Currently, no DNA-binding sites for this regulator have been reported in the literature.  As a member of the DeoR family, GatR features an N-terminal domain containing a putative helix-turn-helix motif <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zeng G,1996. Nobelmann B,1996</a>.			ECK12	Active	
ECK125285363	ECK120012730	GlpR	The <i>sn</i>-<b>Gl</b>ycerol-3-<b>p</b>hosphate <b>r</b>epressor," GlpR, acts as the repressor of the glycerol-3-phosphate regulon, which is organized in different operons <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Larson TJ,1987. Lin EC.,1976. Larson TJ,1992. Yang B,1997. Truniger V,1992. Weissenborn DL,1992. Yang B,1996</a>. This regulator is part of the <i>glpEGR</i> operon, yet it can also be constitutively expressed as an independent (<i>glpR</i>) transcription unit <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yang B,1998. Schweizer H, Boos W, Larson TJ,1985</a>.   In addition, the operons regulated are induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown in the presence of inductor, glycerol, or glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), and the absence of glucose <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Lin EC.,1976</a> In the absence of inductor, this repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that consist of 20-nucleotide-long DNA target sites <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zhao N,1994. Larson TJ,1992. Lin EC.,1976</a>. Binding of GlpR to DNA is diminished in the presence of the inducers glycerol or G3P.  An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed ribose-5-P enhanced GlpR binding to DNA, counteracting the glycerol-3-P dissociation effect <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Vimala A,2016</a>.  GlpR belongs to the DeoR family of transcriptional regulators <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zeng G,1996</a>. Accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in oligomerization and binding of the inducer <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zeng G,1996</a>.   Resequencing of multiple isolates of the MG1655 strain has identified several genetic variations compared to the reference sequence, including a 1-bp deletion in <i>glpR</i> in strain ATCC700926 <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Freddolino PL, Amini S, Tavazoie S,2012</a>.  <a href="http://ecoliwiki.net/colipedia/index.php/Category:Strain:MG1655#Resequencing_of_MG1655_and_comparison_to_the_reference_strain">This EcoliWiki page</a> summarizes these sequence differences.
