Folder for protein stability predictions. INPS and SNAP2 analyses were generated with the help of the respective 
creators.

The 2015-2016 era SNAP2 files for MG1655, REL606, and E. coli W from Zenodo at this link: 
[10.5281/zenodo.4394374](10.5281/zenodo.4394374). These predictions will be regenerated in the future given that SNAP2
has been improved since.

DeMaSk predictions were generated using DeMaSk 1.0 using BLASTP 2.6.0 with Uniref90 (December 2020) manually.
