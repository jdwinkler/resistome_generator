Folder for protein stability predictions. These were generated en-masse thanks to collaborators working 
on INPS and SNAP2.

You can download the 2015-2016 era SNAP2 files for MG1655, REL606, and E. coli W from Zenodo at this link: 
[10.5281/zenodo.4394374](10.5281/zenodo.4394374). These predictions will be regenerated in the future given that SNAP2
has been improved since.
