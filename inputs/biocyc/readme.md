### NCBI Data Preparation

NCBI data used includes the genomic DNA sequence (genomic.fna), RNA from genomic dna, protein, CDSs, feature 
table, and genbank (gbff) files for the following strains:

* W3110: GCF_000010245.2 (RefSeq) + the Genbank file for the Genbank assembly (GCA_000010245.1)
* MDS42: GCA_000350185.1 (Genbank)
* BW25113: GCA_000750555.1 (GenBank)
* BL21(DE3): GCA_000022665.2 (GenBank)
* BL21: GCA_013166975.1 (GenBank)
* MG1655: GCA_000005845.2 (Genbank)
* REL606: GCA_000017985.1 (Genbank)
* W: GCA_000184185.1 (Genbank)

Additionally, the reference proteome tags from Uniprot were obtained on December 21st, 2020 and placed under 
the generic folder to help provide additional synonyms to associate common gene names with their proper 
accessions. This file can be obtained by from the Uniprot Uniproteomes references for *Escherichia coli* K-12 
strains.
