Folder for protein stability predictions. INPS and SNAP2 analyses were generated with the help of the respective 
creators.

The 2015-2016 era SNAP2 files for MG1655, REL606, and E. coli W strains from Zenodo at this link: 
[10.5281/zenodo.4394374](10.5281/zenodo.4394374). These predictions will be regenerated in the future given that SNAP2
has been improved since.

DeMaSk predictions were generated using DeMaSk 1.0 using BLASTP 2.6.0 with Uniref90 (December 2020) manually. Release 
information: 2020_06, 02-Dec-2020. Number of clusters: 131,362,929. Predictions can be downloaded from Zenodo
[10.5281/zenodo.4399936](10.5281/zenodo.4399936) for BW25113, MG1655, REL606, W, W3110, MDS42, BL21, and BL21(DE3).
