Name standardization files for the Resistome. Some key notes:

1. All phenotypes must have an entry in the Compound Information.txt and Stress Classifications.txt files. 
The format of these files should be clear upon inspection. You can use the Compound Information mappings to 
alias many inputs to the same phenotype (e.g. heat tolerance, acid tolerance, ...). Stress Classifications 
servers as a simple phenotype ontology to help generalize from specific phenotypes to more general classes.

Other files for converting gene names into Blattner numbers to better understand cross-strain mutational 
patterns. These may need to be updated if additional E. coli strains are included as Biocyc reference 
databases.
